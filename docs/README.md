Mona.js draws inspiration, wisdom, and guidance from [jQuery Raptorize](https://zurb.com/playground/jquery-raptorize). 

## Getting Started

To get started, [read the guide](https://blocks.githubnext.com/githubnext/universe-blocks-demo?path=docs%2F01+Getting+started.md&branch=main&blockKey=Wattenberger__blocks__mona-tutorial&fileRef=).

Mona.js picks randomly from images in the `/src/images/` folder:
